Understanding Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a cornerstone of modern AI, inspired by the human brain's neural structure. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers: input, hidden, and output layers.

Key Concepts:
Initialization: ANNs start with random weights and biases. Each node has weights (connections strength) and a bias (threshold).
Activation Function: Nodes apply an activation function, like sigmoid, to the weighted sum of inputs to introduce non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex patterns.
Forward Propagation: Inputs pass through the network layer by layer. Each node computes its output and feeds it to the next layer until reaching the output layer, where predictions are made.
